Cheat Document for X-COM: UFO Defense
-------------------------------------
 There are two main areas for cheating.
 One is to edit the base file, and the second is the soldiers file.

   But first a little money:
   -------------------------
 In a save game dir GAME_* edit LIGLOB.DAT with a hex editor
change the first four bytes to: FF FF FF 32
(4*FF will give you minus money)  This gives you
$800 million.

   Base Editing:
   -------------
 Edit the file BASE.DAT in a saved game directory.

 The following information is for the first base; to use it for
other bases, just add 124 Hex for each subsequent base.
The base is a six by six grid defined by the bytes 16 to 39
(3A to 5D is the building time so set them all to 00)

 The following is the list of available buildings:
00 Access Lift                  0A*Plasma Defences
01 Living Quarters              0B Fusion Defences
02 Laboratory                   0C Grav Shield
03 Workshop                     0D Mind Shield
04 Short-range Radar            0E*Psi Lab
05 Long-range Radar             0F Hyper-wave Decoder
06*Missile Defense              10 Top-Left part of Hanger
07 General Stores               11 Top-Right
08 Alien containment            12 Bottom-Left
09*Laser Defenses               13 Bottom-Right

* Are redundant by better facilities
  (Psi Lab not needed if soldier cheat used)

I reccomend the layout given by:
10 11 10 11 03 03    /- -\ /- -\ WS WS
12 13 12 13 03 03    \_ _/ \_ _/ WS WS  (It may be a useful to replace
02 02 00 05 05 03    La La <> LR LR WS   a St (Store) with another FD)
02 02 02 05 05 08    La La La LR LR AC             |
04 04 07 07 07 08    SR SR St St St AC  <----------+
04 04 0D 0B 0C 0F    SR SR MS FD GS HD

NOTE: At the start it is necessary to have a Living Quarters to
       hire the soldiers (say 8), but as soon as they are ordered,
       save the game and remove the quarters.
      Some facilities - Psi Lab, Hyperwave Decoder, Mind Shield,
       Grav Defense - won't work until they have been researched.
      The Access Lift <> is not really necessary unless your base
       is attacked, but after a defense mission without a <> the
       entire base facilities will disappear from the grid.
      Only have 250 (FA) Engineers and Scientists, as 5 will
       go to waste (not to mention the extra salaries)

   Base Equipment:
   ---------------
 As before edit BASE.DAT, and add 124 for extra bases.
 Now instead of values the addresses are given.

 Firstly:
5E Engineers (set to FA)        5F Scientists (set to FA)

 The rest are two byte integers, there are
also gaps in the middle which are not used:

62 Avalanche Launcher           C2 Heavy Plasma
64 Cannon                       C4   Clip

AC Motion Scanner              11E   HWP Fusion Bombs
AE Medi-Kit             AP - Armour Piercing
B0 Psi-Amp              HE - High Explosive
B2 Stun Rod              I - Incendiary (ie Burning)

 I recommend choosing the plasma cannon for the craft weapons, as
they are stronger than anything except for the fusion balls, but the
ships can only carry 2 at a time, while the plasma cannon has 100 shots,
and you don't have to manufacture ammo. Make sure that the base is stocked
up on elerium-115 (it is the only thing you can't make/buy), it is needed
to refuel an Avenger as well as manufacturing most alien things.

   Soldier Editing:
   ----------------
 For each soldier the best outfit is two alien grenades, a motion detector,
a stun rod, heavy laser and psi-amp (maybe even a medi-kit, but with flying
armour, 255 health and time units they are superfluous).
 Edit the file SOLDIER.DAT, each soldier's info takes 68 bytes (00 to 44).
 The first byte is the soldiers rank, set it to 05 for Commander.
 The fifth byte (04) is the craft that the soldier is assigned to, you don't
normally need to change this.
08/09 is a 2 byte integer for the number of missions done.
0A/0B is a 2 byte integer for the number of kills.
0C/0D is the number of days left to heal wounds: set it to 00

To maximise the soldiers stats set the following:
 2A - 33 => FF
      34 => 00
 35 - 3D => FF
And to give the soldier a flying suit: 3E => 03

Thats it for editing...
 Now just a few general tips in using the cheats:

 Make all 8 bases possible, spread them all over the world to maximise the
radar coverage.
 When doing a mission the best strategy is to use a soldier in the back of
the craft to do mind control on any aliens found (should be able to do 10
aliens).  Use the aliens to explore, and if they have any time units left,
make them throw away their weapons, or move them towards your soldiers to get
stunned.  Make sure that the aliens have no time units left at the end of a
turn.  Also the larger aliens (Sectopods, Reapers and Cyberdiscs) can be
taken over one quarter at a time, when you have used up all their time units,
you can take over another quarter, and they get their time units back. It is
important that the larger ones are wholly taken over before and all the time
units are then used up, or they get their own turn.  It is also possible to
get Cyberdiscs to shoot themselves.
 Always do the research as soon as possible, and if there are many things to
research, transfer the items to other bases. Use all 250 scientists at once
to research a job, it will take just as long, but the knowledge from each
separate research item can be used.
 NEVER TRY TO SHOOT DOWN A BATTLESHIP. Even with fusion balls it would take
over 15 shots to knock it down. It is much better to wait for it to land and
send the troops in.
 In terror sites (cities) mind control can also be used on civilians, they
can then help to look around, but don't let them get shot.
 The major goal is to get an Avenger craft, as they are awesome, and they
carry troops as well as having weapons, being fast, able to take lots of
damage, and plenty more.

 In the final mission on Mars, waste no time on the first level, just get all
the soldiers to the green level exit.  It is the second and final part that
is important.
 The brain that you have to shoot is just to the left of the top most green
starting point, but you have to go down, and to the left:
